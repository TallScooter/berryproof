# BerryProof Mod

Berry Proof: Because nobody wants to die from walking through a sweet berry bush.

## Features

- **No more berry damage when wearing armor**: Players wearing tagged leggings are immune to berry bush and cactus damage (all vanilla leggings are enabled by default).
- **Let's be honest, villagers are dumb**: Villagers, iron golems, and wandering traders are enabled by default. 
- **Datapack Support**: Add more protection for vanilla and modded items, entities, or damage sources using tags.
- **Debug Mode**: Enable verbose logging for tag matching.

## Getting Started

1. Download Berry Proof from Curseforge
2. Place BerryProof in your mods folder (Curseforge does this automatically).
3. Configure options in-game via the config screen, or at 'config/berryproof.json'.
4. Customize protection sources and items using the optional datapack for full mod compatibility.

Enjoy a safer berry pricking experience for you and your villagers!
