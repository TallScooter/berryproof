# BerryProof Mod

Because nobody wants to die from walking through a sweet berry bush.

## Features

- **No more berry damage when wearing armor**: Players wearing tagged leggings are immune to berry bush and cactus damage (all vanilla leggings are enabled by default).
- **Let's be honest, villagers aren't the brightest**: Villagers, iron golems, and wandering traders are immune to damage from berry bushes and cactus by default. 
- **Datapack Support**: Add more damage sources, entities and leggings, for vanilla and modded items, using the optional data pack.
- **Debug Mode**: Enable verbose logging for tag matching.
- **Configure options**: in-game via the config screen, or at 'config/berryproof.json'

Enjoy a safer berry pricking experience for you and your villagers!
